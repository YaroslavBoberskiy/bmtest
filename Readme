=== BM Test Project ===

=== Description ===
This is AWS infrastructure part of the Project.
Main components of the infrastructure described in main.tf file:
- Custom VPC;
- Application Load Balancer registered in two AZs - AZ0 and AZ1;
- Two Public networks (as min. requirements for ALB) with one NAT GW in AZ0;
- Internet GW in custom VPC;
- One Private network in AZ0;
- EC2 instance in Private network, so called "Worker";
- EC2 instance in Public network, so called "Bastion";
- Target Group for ALB which contains "Worker" node;
- Security groups:
  - Inbound SG for ALB (ports TCP: 80, 443) and can be limited by list of dedicated IPs;
  - Inbound SG for "Bastion" (ports TCP: 22) and can be limited by list of dedicated IPs;
  - Inbound SG for "Worker" allows inbound connections only from ALB and "Bastion";

=== Security Considerations ===
- Never store "tfstate" locally. Use S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled;
- Use MFA for Programmatic Access AWS account;
- Forward and Keep ALB access logs in S3 bucket;
- Use solutions like AWS Vault/Hashicorp Vault for generating temp access tokens for admin sessions.
- Pay attention that inbound traffic to ALB and Bastion is limited by ports bun NOT limited by subnets.
  It's recommended to fix it in "variables.tf"

=== Additional information ===
Current configuration depends on Route 53 and ACM AWS services which has been configured separately.
After "terraform apply" it's needed to associate ALB with CNAME record in Route 53 configuration manually.
Output provides key, ip ext Elastic IP of Bastion, Internal IPs of Bastion and Worker EC2 instances.
